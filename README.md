## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Load the dataset into Databricks.
3. Run the SQL scripts to clean and analyze the data.
4. Open the Python script to visualize the results and generate AI summaries.
5. Review the AI-generated feedback for insights on category performance and profitability.

## AI Integration

This project connects with OpenAI's GPT-4 API to summarize the performance of product categories based on their profit-to-sales ratio. The AI is prompted with actual data and returns a business-style summary to assist in understanding trends.

## Sample Summary Output

"Technology products show the highest profit ratios. Office Supplies has lower profitability, which could be linked to higher discounting. There is potential to increase profit by adjusting pricing on low-margin items."
